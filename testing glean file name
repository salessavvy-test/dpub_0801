Testing BOLD Chars

Benjamin McMahan: Benjamin had a random thought about the search functionality for Glean apps. He mentioned that it would be beneficial to provide stats/metrics to app creators to help them feel accomplished when their apps are used by many people.1

Jamie Pierce: Jamie had a random thought about creating a future Glean It video. They suggested showcasing the benefit of accessing models like Claude/ChatGPT through Glean, emphasizing how Glean provides crisp and concise answers compared to the more verbose responses from other models.2

Patrick Lynch: Patrick had a random thought about expanding verification features. He mentioned that as the organization grows, it becomes harder to find the best document version for similarly named documents. He suggested implementing verification workflows or audit trails for security documents and approval flows for design document ratifications.3
